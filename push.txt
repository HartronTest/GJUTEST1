Temporarily does the commit
Pushes it to the remote server
Runs the tests (using a CI server, post-receive hook, or ssh)
Reverts the commit if the tests fail
Create an executable called git-test-n-commit and place it in your path:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Committing results..."
git commit "$@"
echo "Pushing to remote testing server..."
git push remote-server-git-url remote-branch -f
echo "Running tests"
ssh remote-server 'cd my_repo; run-my-tests' || 
   (echo "Tests failed, undoing commit" && git reset HEAD^)
